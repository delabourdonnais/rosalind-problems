# rosalind-problems

Teaching myself the fascinating field of Bioinformatics through [Rosalind website](http://rosalind.info).  
I use Python 2.7 wihtout any third party libraries such as biopython, as I need to be implementing the algorithms myself for learning purposes.

The code is written in a quick and dirty way, focusing on solving the problems rather than readability and coding style issues.
